## **Section 2: React Key Concepts**

### React Concepts

-   Before React
-   Why React?
-   Declarative: Don't touch the DOM. I'll do it

    -   State is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.
    -   Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local state is exactly that: a feature available only to classes. State can only be used within a class and usually the only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                name: "John Smith",
            };
        }
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello, my name is {this.state.name}</h1>;
        }
    }
    ```

    -   Nowadays you can use state without the constructor by using Property initializers which is a new feature came out in 2017.

    ```javascript
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
    state = {
        name: 'John Smith'
      }
    }
    render() {
      return <h1>Hello, my name is { this.state.name }</h1>;
    }
    ```

    -   State is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function). State in React Component is its own local state, which means the state cannot be accessed and modified outside the component and can only be used inside it, probably that will remind you of a function own local scope.

-   Component Architecture: Build websites like lego blocks
    -   State + JSX = Component
-   Unidirectional Data Flow
    -   State, Props and Components -> Virtual DOM -> DOM
    -   One Way Data Flow down the DOM
    -   Easy to debug. Goto state location and debug downward
-   UI Layer: UI, The rest is up to you

    -   React: Stove

### How To Be A Great React Developer

-   Decide on Components
-   Decide the state and where it lives
-   What changes when state changes

### NPM vs YARN

-   Install dependencies from package.json: npm install == yarn
-   Install a package and add to package.json: npm install package --save == yarn add package
-   Install a devDependency to package.json: npm install package --save-dev == yarn add package --dev
-   Remove a dependency from package.json: npm uninstall package --save == yarn remove package
-   Upgrade a package to its latest version: npm update --save == yarn upgrade
-   Install a package globally: npm install package -g == yarn global add package
